# Lab 1 - Class & Objects galore

This lab explores foundational object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts, such as class creation, object interaction, and class composition. Through a series of progressive tasks, youâ€™ll build a practical application that includes working with displays, managing data through classes, reading files, and processing text. The lab emphasizes code reuse, modular design, and efficient data handling. Each task builds on previous ones, allowing you to deepen your understanding of OOP principles and class interactions.

### Lab Goals

1. **Understand Core OOP Principles**:
   - Practice creating and using classes, constructors, and object methods.
   - Understand how objects can interact with each other through methods and shared data.
   - Apply encapsulation to organize and manage data within each class effectively.

2. **Develop Skills in Class Reuse and Composition**:
   - Reuse and extend classes to enhance functionality across tasks.
   - Implement class composition by embedding objects within other objects, creating relationships between classes.
   - Explore code reuse strategies to minimize redundancy and enhance code maintainability.

3. **Work with Collections and Iteration**:
   - Use lists to manage collections of objects and iterate through them.
   - Implement methods that sequentially compare or manipulate objects within a list.
   - Understand the value of iterating over data for structured comparisons and data analysis.

4. **Process Files and Parse Text Data**:
   - Handle file input using command-line arguments for greater flexibility.
   - Read and process text data from files, then analyze it by counting characters, words, sentences, and more.
   - Understand string parsing and text manipulation techniques in C#, essential for data processing applications.

5. **Build Command-Line Applications**:
   - Practice passing and using command-line arguments to control program behavior.
   - Enhance usability by allowing multiple files to be processed within a single run.
   - Learn to handle multiple inputs, output formatted data, and manage I/O operations effectively.

6. **Enhance Problem-Solving and Debugging Skills**:
   - Tackle incremental challenges that encourage exploration of C# language capabilities.
   - Develop debugging techniques as you extend functionality across tasks.
   - Gain hands-on experience with class-based architecture in C#, reinforcing best practices.
